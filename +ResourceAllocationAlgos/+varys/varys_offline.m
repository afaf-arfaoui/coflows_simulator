function outputs = varys_offline(fabric,coflows)
% Simulates a workload of coflows where the resource management is done
% according to the method used in Varys system in an offline scenario
% The function returns an outputs variable that stores the average 
% completion time of coflows, a list of coflow completion times and the 
% rates allocated to all flows at each iteration of the process
% Parameters:
% - fabric: the Fabric ojbect representing the network
% - coflows: an array of Coflow objects within the fabric
